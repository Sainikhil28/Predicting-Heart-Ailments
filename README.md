# ❤️ Predicting Heart Ailments Using Machine Learning

## 📄 Abstract
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data mining on real-world health datasets, the model classifies patient data and predicts heart disease risks. The goal is to enable early detection and promote healthier living through a smart, assistive system.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. To develop a machine learning model to predict the possibility of heart disease using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms.  
2. To identify and analyze significant risk factors from medical datasets that contribute to heart disease.  
3. To study and apply feature selection methods to enhance prediction accuracy and model efficiency.
